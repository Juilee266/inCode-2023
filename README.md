According to a study, there are around 43 million blind people worldwide and 295 million people living with moderate-to-severe visual impairment.\
\
Booking rides and traveling independently pose significant challenges for this community.\
Lack of accessible interfaces hinders their ability to navigate and use ride hailing applications
effectively.\
\
This lack of accessibility limits their freedom, mobility, and ability to participate fully in society.\
\
By developing a voice interface for ride hailing, we aim to bridge this accessibility gap, empowering blind and visually impaired individuals to effortlessly book rides, receive real-time updates, and travel with confidence, enhancing their independence and quality of life.
